# Auto Lightsail 

## introduction

Are you bored with the repeated reading assignments on Lightsail?

If true, Auto Lightsail must be your best choice!!!

Auto Lightsail can help you to complete the reading process by auto-clicking the next-page button
*without triggering anti-bot detection*. Even if you come across clozes unfortunately, the script can turn to the previous page automatically 
in order to *conqure the anti-afk detections*. You can simply turn off your monitor after opening a book with the script installed(do not shut down 
the computer).You may also switch to another window during the **downloading** of the book(showing a progress bar) and continue using your computer.

## Installation

Download the *zip file* on the top-right corner on this Github page(Click **<>Code** and **Download Zip**).

---
***ATTENTION***
***Delete readme.md file from the zip file(REALLY IMPORIMPORTANT!!!)***
---
Make sure that you are using Chrome or Edge and have had **Tempermonkey** plug-in installed.If not, please install one from Edge Addon store or
Chrome Addon Store.

On the Dashboard of Tempermonkey, Click Utilities tab and then click Select File under Import.

Select the downloaded zip file and then hit Confirm.

Check whether TemperMonkey is activated on your browser and whether the script is turned on.

Finally, Open Lightsail and select a book to read. You will see the Tempermonkey icon Non-transparent with a foot note 1, which is quite different 
from its appearence when it is not working.
