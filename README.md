# Auto Lightsail 

## introduction

Are you bored with the repeated reading assignments on Lightsail?

If true, Auto Lightsail must be your best choice!!!

Auto Lightsail can help you to complete the reading process by auto-clicking the next-page button
*without triggering anti-bot detection*. Even if you come across clozes unfortunately, the script can turn to the previous page automatically 
in order to *conqure the anti-afk detections*. You can simply turn off your monitor after opening a book with the script installed(do not shut down 
the computer).If a logout warning is present, the script will close it automatically in 6 minutes.

Also, it provides the answer of clozes for you by making the clozes button transparent. However, please note that the order of the letters
may be random due to the encryption of the text. ~~definitely the encryption is much too easy to crack~~

from its appearence when it is not working.
